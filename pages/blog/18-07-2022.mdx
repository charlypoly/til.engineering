## GitHub Automation: a small bot journey

_18/07/2022_

<br/>

**TLDR;**
- Some things seem faster than expected (_build an interactive bot for GitHub to Notion sync is easy with [Probot](https://probot.github.io/)_)
- Some others require more work (_creating a GH App that is mentionable with a custom user (like [`@typescript-bot`](https://github.com/typescript-bot)) requires most work_)

<br/>

As mentioned in the [issue 01-07-2022](https://til.engineering/blog/01-07-2022), we, at [The Guild](https://www.the-guild.dev), aim to be better at sharing knowledge publicly.
In this process, [Dotan](https://github.com/dotansimha) already created a Notion app that helps us syncing Notion Pages with GitHub Discussions: [the-guild-org/notion-github-sync](https://github.com/the-guild-org/notion-github-sync).

### Scaling our newsletter writing process

With the same goal in mind, [we started our monthly newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/TheGuild/).
However, the current process of writing the newsletter is quite cumbersome; we need to ask everybody to go over all the things that happened in the last 30 days and might be worth showcasing.

For this reason, I suggested creating a GitHub bot to help us collect information from our many repositories.



Using [Revue.co](getrevue.co), we could have stuck to their Chrome extension, but it didn't fit for two main reasons:
- we are stuck on the Revue invitations system not allowing us to invite more than one person (bug)
- we aim to have multiple bots (GH, Slack, and more) that would allow us to gather content for multiple mediums (newsletter, blog, tweets)


I end up laying down the following spec:
- the bot should be callable from GH Issues and Pull Requests
- the bot should help tag content for newsletter, blog, tweet, and content backlog
- the bot should support quoting a comment

### The bot stack research

Before jumping to implementation, I looked if the projects that initially inspired this idea ([`@typescript-bot`](https://github.com/typescript-bot) or Renovate) were open-source.

After small searches, I remembered about [GitHub's Probot](https://probot.github.io/) library and started evaluating the fit for our bot's specs.

[Probot](https://probot.github.io/) is easy to set up, with a scaffolding CLI tool and an auto-install mechanism that correctly sets up your GitHub App secrets for you: https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app.

Once set up, listening for issues and PR comments was straightforward: https://github.com/the-guild-org/content-bot/blob/main/src/index.ts#L154-L161

### The `@theguild-content-bot` PoC

Once The Guild content app was correctly set up and received issues, and PRs comments updates, implementing the business logic of pushing the data to Notion was straightforward.

When a comment containing `/theguild <action>` is created by a Guild member, the issue or comment is extracted and [pushed to a Notion database](https://developers.notion.com/docs/working-with-page-content) (table):

If the action type is "newsletter", the next issue name is fetched [from Revue API](https://www.getrevue.co/api#get-/v2/issues/current) (_"NewsletterIssue"_ column).

Once the PoC was ready, I looked at inspiration to deploy it to Vercel Functions ([probot/example-vercel](https://github.com/probot/example-vercel)) and deployed it (which required creating a dedicated production GH App).


### Challenges and learnings

**Challenges**

Implementing the GH comments to Notion lifecycle was fast to implement and deploy (less than half a day).

However, the ideal goal was to make the bot mentionable from GH issues and PRs for a better UX (like [`@typescript-bot`](https://github.com/typescript-bot) and Renovate do).

I find out that achieving such behavior is an undocumented approach and requires the "bot user" to be a contributor to each repository.

Contrary to [`@typescript-bot`](https://github.com/typescript-bot) and Renovate, our bot is not creating PR or commits, requiring us to invite it as a contributor to each repo.

Sadly, a GitHub App cannot invite collaborators using its token [adding collaborators not being part of the allowed "server-to-server" actions of the GH API](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#user-to-server-requests).
Doing so requires setting up a ["Web application flow"](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#web-application-flow) that would grant us the right to doing "user-to-server" actions using the user token, which means:
1. implementing an OAuth workflow, which Probot does not support out of the box
2. store and refresh users tokens (introducing changes in our Serverless setup)

For this reason, our bot will stick to `/theguild newsletter` commands instead of nicer `@theguild-content-bot newsletter` mentions.

Finally, The Guild Content GitHub app, as configured and currently deployed, can only be used by The Guild members (otherwise, everybody will start to update our Notion database).

I find out very hard to find documentation on how to restrict GitHub app installation using Probot and fallback to a user allowlist at the app level.

**Learnings**

This one-day journey in the world of GitHub apps development taught me that simple automation is pretty easy to set up.
Like the [TypeScript Core Team on the TypeScript repository](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Triggering-TypeScript-Bot), we aim to better automate our workflow by leveraging bots to help reproduce bugs and gather content.

On the other hand, there is no cheap success, and setting up an advanced bot workflow requires a more advanced setup with a complete OAuth workflow and good user token management.
