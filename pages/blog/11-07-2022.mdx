## When making progress means slowing down

_11/07/2022 - 14/07/2022_

<br/>

Until recently, I could face most challenges with a "try and fail hard" approach.

Now working in a new domain that requires plenty of new knowledge, I realized that trying to make progress without fully understanding the whole technical picture
led to slow and low-quality progress.

For example, aiming to develop a new Nest GraphQL driver without thoroughly learning the concepts of Nest and the inner working of the `GraphQLModule` was a bad idea.
It was a frustrating and slow experience from which the learnings are mitigated or partial.

To quote an anecdote from [Uri](https://twitter.com/UriGoldshtein), one of the founders of [The Guild](https://www.the-guild.dev/) (_approximate quote_):

> In the past, someone told me that a task is done when you fully understand what you did, which requires taking the necessary time to do it


When thinking about it, I remember that music teachers constantly repeated, "you must practice things slowly first and increase the pace gradually" (advice I always failed to follow).

I guess I should take both pieces of advice more seriously.

Of course, working at a slower pace does not apply to all working places (ex: early-stage startups), but, as part of The Guild, I am embracing our "take time to do things" entirely.
And it works! I already applied to work habit on a [recent PR on codegen CLI](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/pull/8077/), where I took time to fully understands the inner working and architecture of the CLI instead of just trying to patch a bug as fast as possible.

Years of working in startups taught me to "ship as fast as possible" to bring value, know I'll (mainly) focus on investing in knowledge while shipping quality, useful OSS.
