## TDD or not to TDD?

### TDD or not to TDD?

Spend the afternoon [iterating over a ‚Äúfile hierarchy algorithm‚Äù](https://github.com/the-guild-org/the-guild-docs/pull/633) (_I love recursive code üï≥_), going back and forth between the actual usage and implementation to discover edge cases.

Note: try a bit of TDD next time?


### **Building newsletter for decentralized information**

--
_We, at The Guild, work on dozen of OSS projects with distributed ownership, meaning that each repository belongs to its "owner"._
_This is a nice challenge when it comes to centralized changelogs, information in general for a monthly newsletter._
_Following the goal to push the boundaries of open-source, we aim to make most of our discussions, internal doc and any sort of knowledge public, in a scalable and automated way._
_The Guild Newsletter is a first step in this process._

I tried Revue from Twitter today, which I already read things about it before but never used.

It is fitting well with The Guild needs to gather decentralized information from many sources to publish a monthly newsletter, a lot of automation work ahead (with GH and Slack bots, through Revue items API).

Would it make sense to use it for TIL?
