## Ruby threads and node.js packaging

_28/06/2022_

<br />

### Ruby

- Threads: learned that Ruby treats class variable with a reference to the value, making it thread-safe to pass a class variable value to a `Queue` consumed by a `Thread`

### Node.js packaging/bundling

- Faced challenges into properly build a new Node.js package using our internal `bob` builder tool
    - Digged into `lerna` code and other similar tool to understand the structure expected in a published package
        - *TODO*


### k6

- Had the opportunity to invest some time in setuping a proper k6 config to do stress and performance benchmark
    - Learnings: k6 is pretty cool and straighforward, however it would require more time to achieve more advanced use-cases
