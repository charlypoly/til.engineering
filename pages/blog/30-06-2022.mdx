## Node.js packaging (continued) and problem solving

_30/06/2022_

<br/>

### Node.js packaging/bundling

- after many hours struggling finalizing a Nest GraphQL driver facing the following error

```bash
[Nest] 87712  - 28/06/2022, 17:24:55   ERROR [ExceptionHandler] Nest can't resolve dependencies of the YogaDriver. Please make sure that the "graphQlFactory" property is available in the current context.

Potential solutions:
- If GraphQLFactory is a provider, is it part of the current GraphQLModule?
- If GraphQLFactory is exported from a separate @Module, is that module imported within GraphQLModule?
  @Module({
    imports: [ /* the Module containing GraphQLFactory */ ]
  })
```

The issue was related to mismatch of `@nest/*` dependencies.

**Lessons:** 

- **working with multiple packages setup is complicated, accurate versions are important.**
- Remind to pay more attention at dependencies versions, double check warnings and compatibility.

### Facing hard problems

- Nest Plugin issues
    - try/hard with no good understanding of the rules (here: dependency management) is frustrating and not a good way to proceed for me
