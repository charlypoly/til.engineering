# Nextra Blank Custom Theme/Boilerplate Example

A nearly blank MDX blog/content site powered by a custom [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app) theme (see `components/layout.js`) w/Tailwind already setup. 

The post list for the blog index in `pages/index.js` comes out of `./posts.json`. If you wanted to get the Nextra page map to use on the index page, you _could_ make a blank `pages/index.mdx` and move that "page" component into `components/layout` (just check for `route === '/'`) and render it).

Anyways, hopes this helps. Nextra rocks for static content.
